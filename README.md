DataMonsterCpp
==============

This project enables people to instantiate data in a physical way.

In the docs folder: find DataMonster documentation.pdf with photos, partslist, assembly, etc.
Also SVG files of the monster frame pattern for laser cutting.  The PDF files are too big for viewing on GIT, but are visible if you download the zip.  Also the documentation with images is online here:
